# About Me

Hello, I am a master's student with research interests in few-shot learning and multimodal learning. I am proficient in Python and have a good understanding of microcontrollers. I am also interested in algorithm design.

## Research Interests

- **Few-Shot Learning**: I am deeply interested in learning how to make accurate predictions from a limited number of samples.
- **Multimodal Learning**: I am fascinated by the integration and understanding of information from different sources (e.g., visual and auditory).

## Skills

- **Python**: I have a strong command of Python programming, including data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.
- **Microcontrollers**: I have a good understanding of microcontrollers, including programming, interfacing, and hardware design.
- **Algorithm Design**: I am interested in designing efficient and effective algorithms for complex problems.

I look forward to combining my skills and interests in my future research and work to contribute to science and society. Feel free to connect and collaborate with me!
